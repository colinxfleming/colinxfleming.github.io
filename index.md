My professional work is centered around supporting practicioners of various kinds; for the last several years of my career, that's been through software development.

I'm currently a programmer working in Democratic politics; in past roles I've been a data engineer for healthcare.gov digital outreach, a platform engineer for a media company, and a field organizer for state legislative races.

I've spent much of my non-professional time working in the reproductive justice movement. That has included leading the development efforts on an abortion fund case management system; a tour of duty on the DC Abortion Fund board of directors; and many years of clinic defense with the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force.

I also played bass in [Karman Line](https://karmanlinedc.bandcamp.com).
