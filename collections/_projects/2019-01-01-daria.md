excerpt: "I led an open source, all-volunteer project to get the DC Abortion Fund's intake out of a massive spreadsheet starting in 2015. Since deploying in late 2016 it's been adopted by multiple other abortion funds, and those funds have run better operations as a result. My experiences here were the basis for the talks I gave at RubyConf 2018 and RailsConf 2017."
