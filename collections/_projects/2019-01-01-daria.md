Starting in 2015, I led an open source, all-volunteer project with my friendly neighborhood Code for America brigade to get the DC Abortion Fund's intake out of a massive spreadsheet and into a webapp. Since deploying in late 2016 it's been adopted by multiple other abortion funds, and those funds have run better operations as a result. My experiences here were the basis for the talks I gave at RubyConf 2018 and RailsConf 2017.
