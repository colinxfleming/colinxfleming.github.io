excerpt: "I led an open source, all-volunteer project to get the DC Abortion Fund's intake out of a massive spreadsheet starting in 2015. Since then it's expanded to multiple other abortion funds, and those funds have responded in interesting ways."

When I joined the DC Abortion Fund (DCAF) board of directors in 2013, it was starting to become apparent that the steady increased need was not going to settle down. In response, we had increased our fundraising efforts to be able to serve a higher volume of patients with higher levels of cash, but the system we were using to manage that intake had been scaled as far as they were going to go.

That system was a series of spreadsheets organized by patient geography, which had served us well for awhile, but which had really begun to creak. It made it difficult for multiple people working in a geography to work at the same time; intake volunteers overwriting each others' hard work was a semi-regular occurrence. As the volume increased, so did the agony of intake volunteers.

A core team began working with Code for DC, our local Code for America chapter, in the summer of 2015; we planned for a few months, began programming in December, launched a pilot in July 2016, and had fully rolled out in December. 

We built it on a stack of Rails defaults, 

-- some stuff about code for dc and all volunteer stuff

-- some stuff about rails

-- some stuff about impact

-- some stuff about bad decisions in retro
