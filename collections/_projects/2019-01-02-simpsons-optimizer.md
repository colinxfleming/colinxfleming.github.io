excerpt: "SimpsonsWorld is right up there with the wheel for great accomplishments of human civilization. This provides a Random button filtering only to good episodes from a dataset I put together. It can also spit out JSON of season or episode data. It was written in server-side javascript as an excuse to try out Express (VERDICT: It's nice)."
