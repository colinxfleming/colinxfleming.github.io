I have handled a lot of PII in my career and have tried to be very careful with it. This was an effort to distill it into some takeaways and reflect on things that I got wrong the first time and why; it's also encouraging working programmers to face these questions head-on as we build stuff. It draws heavily from my work handling abortion patient data, and what we've done to minimize risks to those individuals. As a bonus, there's a point in the video where I completely space on how PowerPoint works, and this heavily features a dril tweet, so this talk really does have it all.
