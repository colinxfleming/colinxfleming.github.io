categories: talk railsconf
excerpt: "The first talk I ever gave, at RailsConf 2017! It was a reflection on my experience running a community project at Code for DC, and how I was surprised to draw on my former experiences as a community organizer in Phoenix more heavily than I thought I would. It's more or less an argument for leaning in to the community parts of open source work, and the importance of other people in making sure our work doesn't go to waste if we need to step back."
