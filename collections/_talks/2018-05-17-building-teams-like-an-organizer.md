A talk about experiences applying principles of community organizing to programming work, and how it isn't a huge departure from how we work now. It was a reflection on my experience running a community project at Code for DC, and my surprise at drawing former experiences as a community organizer more heavily than I thought I would. It's more or less an argument for leaning in to the community and people parts of open source work, and the importance of other people in making sure open source work doesn't fade away if maintainers need to step back. (Also the first talk I ever gave at a conference.)
